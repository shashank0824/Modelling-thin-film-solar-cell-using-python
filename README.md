A phenomenological model has been developed to simulate the efficiency of thin-film solar cells. This model incorporates key equations for p-n heterojunctions and includes mechanisms such as radiative recombination, Auger recombination, Shockley–Read–Hall recombination, and surface recombination losses. It is designed for final-year undergraduate and Master's students, relating key solar cell phenomena to an equivalent circuit that determines maximum conversion efficiency under standard AM1.5 solar illumination. 

The model's physical basis is explained, alongside algorithms that enable numerical simulations of a solar cell under various operating conditions. It accounts for optical losses within the device and uses shunt resistance to represent recombination losses. By adjusting layer thicknesses and doping levels, the model can optimize solar cells for efficiency or other operational characteristics.

This model is applied to explore an emerging solar technology: thin-film p-n heterojunction Cu2ZnSnS4/CdS solar cells. An optimized solar cell achieves a photovoltaic conversion efficiency of (10 ± 1)%, though significant uncertainties in some Cu2ZnSnS4 material properties make the model's predicted trends more valuable for understanding underlying physical phenomena in a solar cell. A region of maximum efficiency is identified for absorber layer thicknesses on the order of microns, with the range of CdS thicknesses that maximizes this region found when the CdS n-type doping concentration is at its peak. Efficiency sharply drops when the CdS doping concentration is lower than that of Cu2ZnSnS4. 

Varying device and material parameters provides insight into solar cell operation, allowing strategies to be tested for managing optical and carrier losses and identifying designs optimized for high-efficiency thin-film solar cells. The model is adaptable to other thin-film photovoltaic technologies by inputting appropriate material properties
